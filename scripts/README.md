# Scripts

The scripts in this directory are used mostly as reference and not as actual executables.

- `experiments.sh` is a script that queues multiple experiments using [task spooler](http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/soft/ts/). It needs to be installed through the Linux package manager (as task-spooler, tsp or ts). On some distros, the program is called `ts`, on others it is `tsp`.
- `get_trainable_params.sh` is a script that performs dry runs of multiple networks, to get the number of trainabe params in them.
- `install.sh` downloads StarCraft 2.
